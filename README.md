# DiabetesProject

This project details the process of developing predictive models to classify the onset of diabetes through supervised learning algorithms using the Pima Diabetes dataset. Various supervised learning algorithms are evaluated, tested, and compared to achieve the
most accurate classification model. Important health parameters relevant towards diabetes are often times
missing in a patient’s medical record, which was addressed using techniques of preprocessing and imputation of
the data.The classifier’s performance results were studied separately as accuracy and precision were key metrics
in determining the success rates of all the classifiers. The code that was run on AWS instances is outlined in classification.py, and is the source of the metrics and plots seen in the report named Supervised Learning Report.pdf. References to the dataset as well as other resources can be found in the report document as well.
